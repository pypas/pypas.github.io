The fourth project of Robert Heaton's series [Programming Projects For Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/11/03/programming-project-4-photomosaics/).

Writen in Ruby, this project turns a picture into a photomosaics made of other smaller images. The [Minimagick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) gem was used for image processing. 

The Git repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/pypas/photomosaics).
