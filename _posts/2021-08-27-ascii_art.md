title: ASCII Art
---

<span class="badge py">Python</span>

A simple project that converts images into ASCII art, inspired by Robert Heaton's series of [Programming Projects For Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/).

This project was written in Python and uses [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) as the image processing library. [Here](https://github.com/pypas/ascii-art) is the code.
